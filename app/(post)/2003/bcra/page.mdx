At the Central Bank of Argentina,

I began my career as a Help Desk professional, but my passion for software development led me to join the development team responsible for important systems that handle multi millions of dollars on a daily basis.

I worked on critical projects and played a significant role in ensuring their success.

As part of the development team, I learned how to work collaboratively with different stakeholders to develop effective solutions that met business requirements.

The experience taught me valuable skills in software development, project management, and teamwork.

I am proud of my contributions to these critical systems that help keep the financial infrastructure of the country running smoothly.
