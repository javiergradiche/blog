As a university teacher, I taught various non-typical academic subjects, with a focus on providing practical knowledge to prepare students for the working market. Some of the key subjects I covered were:

Agile Methodologies: I taught various Agile methodologies like XP, Scrum, Kanban, and Lean, providing students with hands-on experience in implementing them in real-world scenarios.

GIT: I educated students on the use of GIT, a version control system that is widely used in the software development industry. I covered advanced topics such as branching, merging, pull request, versioning, and release management.

CICD: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) are crucial components of modern software development practices. I helped students understand the importance of CICD and how to implement it in software development projects.

Other Tools: Apart from these subjects, I also taught other tools and technologies that are commonly used in the working market, including JIRA, Trello, and various project management tools.

Through my teaching, I aimed to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the working market and provide practical solutions to real-world problems.

By incorporating topics like pull request, versioning, and release management, I helped students gain a deeper understanding of the software development process and its best practices.
