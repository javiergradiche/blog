Sourced platform allows data extraction from LinkedIn profiles, sending automated messages, analyzing responses, and managing client-specific hiring workflows.

I lead the creation of the platform from scratch, including the infra, cicd pipelines, front and back.

As a Senior FullSStack Developer for Sourced, I took a leadership role for the development and maintenance of web applications, leveraging my extensive knowledge of Ruby on Rails and front-end technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

In addition, I contributed to the application's front-end development using React and to automate all infra as code using terraform on AWS.

As a senior team member, I also provided guidance and support to other developers on the team.

I was responsible for writing high-quality, maintainable code and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in web development introducing AI capabilities to the platform.
