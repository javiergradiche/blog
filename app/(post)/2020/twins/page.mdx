Becoming a parent is an experience that changes a person's life forever, and this is especially true for me. In November of 2020, I was blessed with the arrival of twins during the midst of the Covid pandemic. From the moment they were born, my life has been filled with new joys, challenges, and rewards.

Being a parent to twins is an experience unlike any other, and I feel incredibly grateful to have these two precious little ones in my life. They have taught me so much about love, patience, and perseverance, and I am constantly amazed by their curiosity and resilience.

Despite the challenges of raising children during a pandemic, my twins have brought immeasurable joy and laughter to my life, and I am proud to be their parent. I look forward to watching them grow and develop into their own unique individuals, and I am excited to see all the amazing things they will accomplish in their lives.
